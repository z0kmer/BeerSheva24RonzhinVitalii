Elves (Homo sapiens nobilis) appeared for the first time in 2011. Starting from this year, some human mothers bore dwarvish or elvish children.[3] Medical researchers called the transformation of these babies Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE). The designation as "Elves" was first coined by the print magazine Newsweek, in an editorial published on March 14, 2011, which American and world media picked up and spread worldwide.
