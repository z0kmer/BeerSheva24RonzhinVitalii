Orks (Homo sapiens robustus) are a metahuman race in the awakened world present since the 1st edition. They are the most numerous and least respected of the metahuman races,[1] often seen as an outsider.[2] Their reproduction rate is higher and they are second in population after humans.

The first orks of the Sixth World emerged during the Unexplained Genetic Expression in the year 2021 as either young humans changed to orks or ones born as orks from human parents. They are considered metahumans, like trolls, elves, and dwarves. Orks are able to interbreed with humans and fellow metahumans. Despite this, their offspring will be of the race of only one of their parents. No half-breeds exist.
