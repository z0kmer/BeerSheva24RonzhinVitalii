Dwarfs (Homo sapiens pumilionis) first appeared in 2011. Starting from this year, human mothers began bearing dwarven and elven babies. Medical researchers called this transformation Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE).
Dwarfs are smallest metamuhan race, on average shorter than humans; their average height is under 120cm. Remarkable features include the dwarfs' small body size, short legs and full beards. Unlike humans with dwarfism, true dwarfs have upper bodies that are proportionately larger than their lower bodies compared to humans. Their skin color varies in a similar fashion to humans, with colors ranging from white to black. It is assumed that dwarfs have an average life expectancy of well over 100 years, although proof is still forthcoming. Dwarfs see in a broader spectrum than humans, which allows them to have natural thermographic vision. In addition, dwarfs clearly have a more efficient immune system than humans do, which makes them resistant to most diseases and patogens.
